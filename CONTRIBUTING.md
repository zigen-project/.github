# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Zwin!!!

Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zwin-project/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to keep our community approachable and respectable.

This guide applies to repositories in the [zwin-project](https://github.com/zwin-project),
but instructions within each repository will always take precedence over
this guide, unless otherwise noted.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from
opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Check [the overall contribution guides](https://zwin.dev/contribution) to see
what types of contributions we accept.
Some don't even require writing a single line of code.

## Issues

### Create a new issue

Before submitting a new issue, please search if an issue already exists.
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

If the repository has issue forms, use them as much as possible.
However, it is not always necessary to follow the form if it is easier to
express your ideas clearly without it.

## Before making changes

If you are trying to make a significant change, we strongly recommend that
you discuss the proposal with the maintainers, in case your changes do not
match the maintainers' milestone.
Neither you nor we will be happy to see your hard work go to waste.

If you have a concrete plan or idea, please share it by submitting an issue.
If you need a discussion to form a concrete specification or
implementation plan, please contact us on discord.
